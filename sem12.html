          <p align="justify"> The first few days of the week we're dedicated to write down the first version of my thesis skeleton, where I defined all the topics that I'll be writing in the next couple of weeks. This process allowed me to review some of the work I've done since the begining of this project and how far I've come.</p>
          <p align="justify">  Apart from the usual chapters of any thesis, the Introduction, the Experimental Interface, etc the core of the thesis is divided in three main chapters: the Tests and Results, the Collision Zone Detection and Ego-Motion Study. The Collision Zone Detection was my first goal when I took this challenge and I can probably say it was accomplished , although since it depends on other programs this work can only be as right as it's dependencies. After completing the first goal I started studying the efects of the Atlascar ego-motion, specially while it is turning, on the velocity given by the GNN. The work is still in development but I believe that I'm close to getting a result. The Test and Results chapter is where things got complicated for me. I find it quite hard to develop a test to prove my work. Since it is related to collisions, I have to come up with a test that proves that there will be a collision while at the same time ensuring the safety of the Atlascar and all it's components. More though must be made on this subject as it is probably the most important chapter of my thesis.</p>
          <p align="justify"> In the off time of the skeleton writing I continued the last week's work. With most of the theory of the problem already defined I went on to determine the relationship between the Atlascar steering wheel and the wheel's angle. This angle will then be used to calculate the turning center point as described last week.</p>
          <p align="justify"> Many approaches could be made to find out the angle, however due to the lack of information about this topic I decided to use a simple approximation. Knowing the maximum wheel angle of both the inner and outer wheel (45ยบ and 38ยบ respectively), and maximum steering wheel angle to both sides (635ยบ), I calculated the steering wheel ratio for both the inner and outer wheel with (1) using the know values defined before. </p>
          $$Steering~wheel~ratio = {Steering~wheel~angle \over wheel~angle}~~~~~~~~(1)$$

          </figure>
          <p align="justify"> This concept is hard to grasp and many variables influence this velocity error, such as the speed of the car, the frenquency of the targets topic, although not massivly, the distance of the target to the turning center point, and the turning center point itself. This last variable is related to the car steering wheel. In order to prove this theory with the bagfile I have, I asked my colleague Diogo his bagfile wich he recorded during our ride back when I took my data. In his bagfile he recorded the velocity and the steering wheel of the Atlascar and although mine and his data weren't recorded precisely at the same time I can still get a approximation of this error efect. However this relation between the steering wheel angle, the wheel angle and turning radius is not easy to calculate. In order to prevent wheel slip and get a better control of the car while turning, all the wheel travel at different speeds, and the front wheel's make a different angle. This front wheel angle difference is called the "Ackermann steering geometry" and every car can have a different application of this geometry. In the Atlascar manual states that the car has 3.49 number of turns of the steering wheel to both sides, multiplying this by 360 we get the steering wheel angle of 1256.4 degrees, dividing by 2 we know that wheel making a full left or right the steering wheel rotates 628.2 degrees. During a turn at max steering wheel angle the inner wheel makes 45 degrees and the outer wheel 38 degrees. I know that the Atlascar uses a rack and pinion typer of steering and know that the rack moves 41.08 mm per steering wheel turn. I can use this relation and the value from the max turn of the from wheels to get a linear equation to the front wheel angles, however I didn't find any works wich confirms this, and is at the very least an approximation. The study of the velocity with Diogo's data has not yet been done, only then I can prove the theory with practice, nevertheless I can prove that there is in fact errors in the velocity since that after reviewing the velocity values after this I realised that in fact the relative velocity between the Atlascar and some know static targets were in some cases throw the roof reaches values up to 30 km/h while the Atlascar was just moving that 5 km/h mark. In some other cases with the targets with the same approximate distance to the car, the values were lower than the actual 5 km/h this is due to the location of said target being in the right side while performing a right turn (fig 2).  </p>
